<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">words and kisses lost in the wind.</p><p>On the hillside a poor devil wandered about with his stick in the midst
of the diligences. A mass of rags covered his shoulders, and an old
staved-in beaver, turned out like a basin, hid his face; but when he
took it off he discovered in the place of eyelids empty and bloody
orbits. The flesh hung in red shreds, and there flowed from it liquids
that congealed into green scale down to the nose, whose black nostrils
sniffed convulsively. To speak to you he threw back his head with an
idiotic laugh; then his bluish eyeballs, rolling constantly, at the
temples beat against the edge of the open wound. He sang a little song
as he followed the carriages--</p><p>“Maids an the warmth of a summer day Dream of love, and of love always”</p><p>And all the rest was about birds and sunshine and green leaves.</p></div> </div>
