long barrel of a carbine that seemed to be aimed at her. It stuck out
sideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in the grass on the
edge of a ditch. Emma, half-fainting with terror, nevertheless walked
on, and a man stepped out of the tub like a Jack-in-the-box. He had

trembling lips, and a red nose. It was Captain Binet lying in ambush for
wild ducks.</p><p>“You ought to have called out long ago!” he exclaimed; “When one sees a
