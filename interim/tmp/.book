His hair was cut square on his forehead like a village\nchorister’s; he looked reliable, but very ill at ease. Although he was\nnot broad-shouldered, his short school jacket of green cloth with black\nbuttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at the\nopening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare. His legs, in\nblue stockings, looked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by\nbraces, He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.</p><p>We began repeating the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as\nattentive as if at a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean\non his elbow; and when at two o’clock the bell rang, the master was\nobliged to tell him to fall into line with the rest of us.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When we came back to work, we were in the habit of</p>",

Oval,\nstiffened with whalebone, it began with three round knobs; then came in\nsuccession lozenges of velvet and rabbit-skin separated by a red band;\nafter that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered with\ncomplicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord,\nsmall twisted gold threads in the manner of a tassel.

As opposed to the maternal ideas, he had a certain\nvirile idea of childhood on which he sought to mould his son, wishing\nhim to be brought up hardily, like a Spartan, to give him a strong\nconstitution. He sent him to bed without any fire, taught him to drink\noff large draughts of rum and to jeer at religious processions. But,\npeaceable by nature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions. His\nmother always kept him near her; she cut out cardboard for him, told him\ntales, entertained him with endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety\nand charming nonsense. In her life’s isolation she centered on the\nchild’s head all her shattered, broken little vanities. She dreamed of\nhigh station; she already saw him, tall, handsome, clever, settled as\nan engineer or in the law. She taught him to read, and even, on an old\npiano, she had taught him two or three little songs. But to all this\nMonsieur Bovary, caring little for letters, said, “It was not worth\nwhile.</p>",

Meanwhile he grew like an oak; he was strong on\nhand, fresh of colour.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When he was twelve years old his mother had her own way; he began\nlessons.

On other occasions,\nwhen Monsieur le Cure, on his way back after administering the viaticum\nto some sick person in the neighbourhood, caught sight of Charles\nplaying about the fields, he called him, lectured him for a quarter of\nan hour and took advantage of the occasion to make him conjugate his\nverb at the foot of a tree.

But his\nwife was master; he had to say this and not say that in company, to fast\nevery Friday, dress as she liked, harass at her bidding those patients\nwho did not pay. She opened his letter, watched his comings and goings,\nand listened at the partition-wall when women came to consult him in his\nsurgery.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She must have her chocolate every morning, attentions without end.

Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from\nwhich manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six\npeacocks, a luxury in Chauchois farmyards, were foraging on the top of\nit. The sheepfold was long, the barn high, with walls smooth as your\nhand. Under the cart-shed were two large carts and four ploughs, with\ntheir whips, shafts and harnesses complete, whose fleeces of blue wool\nwere getting soiled by the fine dust that fell from the granaries. The\ncourtyard sloped upwards, planted with trees set out symmetrically,</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and\nthe chattering noise of a flock of geese was heard near the pond.</p><p>A young woman in a blue merino dress with three flounces came to the\nthreshold of the door to receive Monsieur Bovary, whom she led to the\nkitchen, where a large fire was blazing. The servant’s breakfast was\nboiling beside it in small pots of all sizes. Some damp clothes were\ndrying inside the chimney-corner. The shovel, tongs, and the nozzle\nof the bellows, all of colossal size, shone like polished steel, while\nalong the walls hung many pots and pans in which the clear flame of the\nhearth, mingling with the first rays of the sun coming in through the\nwindow, was mirrored fitfully.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Charles went up the first floor to see the patient.

By\nhis side on a chair stood a large decanter of brandy, whence he poured\nhimself a little from time to time to keep up his spirits; but as soon\nas he caught sight of the doctor his elation subsided, and instead of\nswearing, as he had been doing for the last twelve hours, began to groan\nfreely.</p><p>The fracture was a simple one, without any kind of complication.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Charles could not have hoped for an easier case. Then calling to mind\nthe devices of his masters at the bedsides of patients, he comforted the\nsufferer with all sorts of kindly remarks, those caresses of the surgeon\nthat are like the oil they put on bistouries. In order to make some\nsplints a bundle of laths was brought up from the cart-house. Charles\nselected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment\nof windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and\nMademoiselle Emma tried to sew some</p>",

Charles was surprised at the whiteness of her nails.\nThey were shiny, delicate at the tips, more polished than the ivory of\nDieppe, and almond-shaped. Yet her hand was not beautiful, perhaps not\nwhite enough, and a little hard at the knuckles; besides, it was too\nlong, with no soft inflections in the outlines. Her real beauty was in\nher eyes. Although brown, they seemed black because of the lashes, and\nher look came at you frankly, with a candid boldness.</p><p>The bandaging over, the doctor was invited by Monsieur Rouault himself\nto “pick a bit” before he left.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Charles went down into the room on the ground floor.

With her black\nhair, her large eyes, her aquiline nose, her birdlike walk, and always\nsilent now, did she not seem to be passing through life scarcely\ntouching it, and to bear on her brow the vague impress of some divine\ndestiny? She was so sad and so calm, at once so gentle and so reserved,\nthat near her one felt oneself seized by an icy charm, as we shudder\nin churches at the perfume of the flowers mingling with the cold of the\nmarble. The others even did not escape from this seduction. The chemist\nsaid--</p><p>“She is a woman of great parts, who wouldn’t be misplaced in a\nsub-prefecture.”</p><p>The housewives admired her economy, the patients her politeness, the\npoor her charity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But she was eaten up with desires, with rage, with hate.

  "page-253": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it might not be evident,\nthat she might make it less.

She was irritated by\nan ill-served dish or by a half-open door; bewailed the velvets she had\nnot, the happiness she had missed, her too exalted dreams, her narrow\nhome.</p>",
  "page-254": "<p>What exasperated her was that Charles did not seem to notice her\nanguish. His conviction that he was making her happy seemed to her an\nimbecile insult, and his sureness on this point ingratitude. For whose\nsake, then was she virtuous?

  "page-255": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">She was surprised\nsometimes at the atrocious conjectures that came into her thoughts, and\nshe had to go on smiling, to hear repeated to her at all hours that she\nwas happy, to pretend to be happy, to let it be believed.</p><p>Yet she had loathing of this hypocrisy. She was seized with the\ntemptation to flee somewhere with Leon to try a new life; but at once a\nvague chasm full of darkness opened within her soul.</p><p>“Besides, he no longer loves me,” she thought. “What is to become of me?\nWhat help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?”</p><p>She was left broken, breathless, inert, sobbing in a low voice, with\nflowing tears.</p><p>“Why don’t you tell master?” the servant asked her when she came in\nduring these crises.</p><p>“It is the nerves,” said Emma. “Do not speak to him of it; it would\nworry him.”</p>",

She is so finiky about her\npleasures; and, besides, she has a mania for prawns.”</p><p>The fields were empty, and around him Rodolphe only heard the regular\nbeating of the grass striking against his boots, with a cry of the\ngrasshopper hidden at a distance among the oats. He again saw Emma in\nher room, dressed as he had seen her, and he undressed her.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, I will have her,” he cried, striking a blow with</p>",

By what means? We shall always be having the brat\non our hands, and the servant, the neighbours, and husband, all sorts of\nworries. Pshaw! one would lose too much time over it.”</p><p>Then he resumed, “She really has eyes that pierce one’s heart like a\ngimlet. And that pale complexion! I adore pale women!”</p><p>When he reached the top of the Arguiel hills he had made up his mind.\n“It’s only finding the opportunities. Well, I will call in now and then.\nI’ll send them venison, poultry; I’ll have myself bled, if need be. We\nshall become friends; I’ll invite them to my place.

Then, from looking at this\nimage and recalling the memory of its original, Emma’s features little\nby little grew confused in his remembrance, as if the living and the\npainted face, rubbing one against the other, had effaced each other.\nFinally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations\nrelating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business\nnotes. He wanted to see the long ones again, those of old times.

His insipid voice murmured like a\nrunning brook; a light shone in his eyes through the glimmering of his\nspectacles, and his hand was advancing up Emma’s sleeve to press her\narm. She felt against her cheek his panting breath. This man oppressed\nher horribly.</p><p>She sprang up and said to him--</p>",

  "page-692": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">too far.</p><p>“What a wretch! what a scoundrel! what an infamy!” she said to herself,\nas she fled with nervous steps beneath the aspens of the path. The\ndisappointment of her failure increased the indignation of her outraged\nmodesty; it seemed to her that Providence pursued her implacably, and,\nstrengthening herself in her pride, she had never felt so much esteem\nfor herself nor so much contempt for others. A spirit of warfare\ntransformed her. She would have liked to strike all men, to spit in\ntheir faces, to crush them, and she walked rapidly straight on, pale,\nquivering, maddened, searching the empty horizon with tear-dimmed eyes,\nand as it were rejoicing in the hate that was choking her.</p><p>When she saw her house a numbness came over her.

In\nyour own house you do not possess a chair, a pin, a straw, and it is I,\npoor man, who have ruined you.”</p><p>Then there would be a great sob; next he would weep abundantly, and at\nlast, the surprise past, he would forgive her.</p>",
  "page-694": "<p>“Yes,” she murmured, grinding her teeth, “he will forgive me, he who\nwould give a million if I would forgive him for having known me!

Then,\nwhether she confessed or did not confess, presently, immediately,\nto-morrow, he would know the catastrophe all the same; so she must wait\nfor this horrible scene, and bear the weight of his magnanimity. The\ndesire to return to Lheureux’s seized her--what would be the use? To\nwrite to her father--it was too late; and perhaps, she began to repent\nnow that she had not yielded to that other, when she heard the trot of\na horse in the alley. It was he; he was opening the gate; he was whiter\nthan the plaster wall. Rushing to the stairs, she ran out quickly to the\nsquare; and the wife of the mayor, who was talking to Lestiboudois in\nfront of the church, saw her go in to the tax-collector’s.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She hurried off to tell Madame Caron, and the two</p>",
